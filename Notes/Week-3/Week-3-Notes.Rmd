## All together now

### Command Guide
Review the 1-page command guide: ["Enough R for DCF"](http://dtkaplan.github.io/DCF-2014/CourseNotes/Guides/EnoughDCF.pdf)



### World Cities data.

* Plot the latitude and longitude of the cities.
* Find the total urban population of each country.  
    * Plot this as a choropleth map.
    * Plot this as a scatter plot, using median latitude and longitude for each country to set position.
* Extremes
    * Find the northernmost city. 
    * Find the city closest to the equator.
    
## Group Activities

1. [Popularity of names](Notes/Week-3/Week-3-Handout.pdf)
2. [Bird species](Notes/Week-3/Week-3-Handout.pdf)


WEEK 4 -- CVC/Summer2014/Activities/Migration.Rmd --- there are all sorts of rank comparisons here involving the maximum, top five, and so on.



Pick out the zip codes you would target for:

* lots of elderly.
* young people and high income.

* Where do the elderly live in the US?  Zip-code data: see <file:///Users/kaplan/KaplanFiles/MOSAIC/CVC/Summer2014/Notes/GraphicsBasics/graphics-basics.html#17>



Medicare spending: see the questions at <file:///Users/kaplan/KaplanFiles/DCF-2014/CaseStudies/MedicareSpending/notes.html>

* Groupwise means and sd.
* Counts using group_by() and n().  (Group by the levels of the variable to be counted, perhaps including another variable for subdivisions.)

* Add a layer to a map, perhaps zip-code population with state boundaries.

* Who votes for whom?  Wade county voters: create cross tabs on registration, etc.  Make bar charts to display patterns.
