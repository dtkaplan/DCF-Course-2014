* Groupwise means and sd.
* Counts using group_by() and n().  (Group by the levels of the variable to be counted, perhaps including another variable for subdivisions.)
* Converting counts to proportions. (Divide by sum().)
    ```{r}
    KidsFeet %>% group_by( biggerfoot,sex ) %>% 
    summarise(count=n() )
    ```
* Graphics with mPlot(), mBar(), mMap()

* Add a layer to a map, perhaps zip-code population with state boundaries.

* Who votes for whom?  Wade county voters: create cross tabs on registration, etc.  Make bar charts to display patterns.
