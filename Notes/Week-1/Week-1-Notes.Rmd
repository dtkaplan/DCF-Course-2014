## Some examples of contemporary data

### Taxicabs and the Shared Economy

A team of mathematicians and engineers has calculated that if taxi riders were willing to share a cab, New York City could reduce the current fleet of 13,500 taxis up to 40 percent. [Link to news story](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/02/science/sharing-taxis-nyc-mathematics.html) and an [interactive site](http://www.hubcab.org/) with the data.

## Infrastructure

### RStudio

* Windows, panes, and tabs in RStudio.
* R/Markdown  
    * Opening an Rmd file for editing.
    * Saving Rmd files
    * Compiling Rmd to HTML
* Handing in files
    * Upload HTML files to Moodle.
    * Downloading from RStudio server to your desktop so that you can upload them to Moodle.

### Creating an Rmd File 

Create an Rmd file named `Class-1.Rmd`.  Eventually, you will upload your HTML file to Moodle, under [In-class, Week 1](https://moodle.macalester.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=21352)

Markdown for ...

* Headings, lists, mathematics
* Links, images
* R code chunks

TASK: Create an narrative description of your classes this term.  Include links to the Moodle site, links to a relevant Wikipedia (or other) article, and an embedded figure (perhaps from Wikipedia).

## Tidy Data

Basics: Cases, Variables, rows, columns, quantitative, categorical

### Exercises: Put these into tidy form.  

Divide into groups and put your answer to the following in these spreadsheets:[Group-1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am13enSalO74dHNpejZtd3dQTXlPM245R0ZQbG0yYkE&usp=sharing), [Group-2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am13enSalO74dHk1enZoVnhrV09ad2x4dXR1MlpWNFE&usp=sharing), [Group-3](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am13enSalO74dElIQkh0SWtyaW9aRkdMZVBERHdJNXc#gid=0), [Group-4](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am13enSalO74dEYxdEhWZUI1S3NxN2ZaaThXSEtMVWc&usp=sharing), [Group-5](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am13enSalO74dDVsLWJaUHV5emFVQlVfSjFrdmFkYXc&usp=sharing), [Group-6](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am13enSalO74dFdvNGpFZkNuUHZqd2g2UEVDc0VEZEE&usp=sharing)

Make a separate tab for each table.

#### Height measurements

In the 1880s, Francis Galton started to make a mathematical theory of evolution.  

Here's part of a page from his lab notebook.  Translate it into tidy form.

When done, upload it to Moodle, under [In-class, Week 1](https://moodle.macalester.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=21352).


## The assignment document for next week

Start on [Assignment 1](http://dtkaplan.github.io/DCF-2014/Assignments/Assignment-One).  

* Create an Rmd document named `AssignmentOne-XXX.Rmd` (where `XXX` is your initials).
* Eventually, by class next week, you'll hand it in on Moodle, [Week-1 Assignment hand in site](https://moodle.macalester.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=19069).
