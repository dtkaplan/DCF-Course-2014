## Starters

* Teach tab completion for variable names, function names, and arguments
* Using Rmd files.

### An example of available data

Files you can download: Examples:    
* US Census data <http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml?refresh=t>
* New York City 311 calls <https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9>.  Here's [the graph of complaint count against time](http://dtkaplan.github.io/DCF-2014/CourseNotes/ScrapingData/311-Calls.html)

  They don't need to master this.  Conversion to CSV, yes. A tutorial? <http://www.r-bloggers.com/read-excel-files-from-r/>

[Not so big activity](NotSoBig.pdf)



## Cleaning

* types: numerical, factor, string, ... how to examine them.
* are there values that just shouldn't be there: "J" for sex.
* checking against a priori bounds, e.g. month is 1:12, day is 1:31, wing-span is < 1 m
* inner_join against a translation table
* regular expressions using extract to, say, 
    * breaking a string with two or more variables into the separate variables.
    * pull out numbers from a string.  Using mutate() 
    * maybe [this package](http://www.r-bloggers.com/canned-regular-expressions-qdapregex-0-1-2-on-cran/) or <RegEx101.com>
