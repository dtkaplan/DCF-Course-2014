Use the Bird cleaning data from the exercise you originally intended for week 3.

## Scraping

A bit about finding data.  What's data and what's a summary.  If it's not in something like tabular form, give up.

### Types of Files

* html
* csv
* xlsx
* package-specific files

### How to read them in.

* XML for picking tables.  Can we make a command that head()s all of the tables in the list so that you can pick one out? lapply()

* Demo of foreign   --- find some sites with package-specific data

* XLSX --- show that it can be done.  They don't need to master this.  Conversion to CSV, yes.

* text files

## Cleaning

* types: numerical, factor, string, ... how to examine them.
* are there values that just shouldn't be there: "J" for sex.
* checking against a priori bounds, e.g. month is 1:12, day is 1:31, wing-span is < 1 m
* inner_join against a translation table
* regular expressions using extract to, say, 
    * breaking a string with two or more variables into the separate variables.
    * pull out numbers from a string.  Using mutate() 
    * maybe [this package](http://www.r-bloggers.com/canned-regular-expressions-qdapregex-0-1-2-on-cran/) or <RegEx101.com>
