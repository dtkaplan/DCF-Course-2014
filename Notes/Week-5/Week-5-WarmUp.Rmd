```{r child="../../CSS/DCF-common.Rmd"}
```

```{r ref_label="../../CSS/DCF-for-PDF.Rmd"}
```

```{r include=FALSE }
library( knitr )
opts_chunk$set( echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide" ) 
```

Do this work in an Rmd file named `Week-5-Warmup-XXX.Rmd`.^[`XXX` should be replaced by your personal ID, e.g. your initials.]  Rather than typing commands at the console, type them into a chunk and run that chunk in the console. (If you're not sure what this means, ask!  There is a keyboard shortcut that makes it easy.)  When the chunk does what you want, compile the Rmd document to HTML.  Then move on to the next task and repeat the cycle: compose, get it working, compile to HTML.

You will use four data tables in this exercise:

1. `ZipGeography` in the `DCF` package.
2. `Restaurants` which you must load into R.
3. `Cuisines` ............. ditto ...
4. `ViolationCodes` .........ditto ...

Read in (2), (3), and (4) with these commands:
```{r eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
load( url( "http://tinyurl.com/m4o4n2b/DCF/ViolationCodes.rda" ) ) 
load( url( "http://tinyurl.com/m4o4n2b/DCF/Cuisines.rda" ) )
load( url( "http://tinyurl.com/m4o4n2b/DCF/Restaurants.rda" ) )
```

```{r cache=TRUE,include=FALSE}
load("Restaurants.rda")
load("ViolationCodes.rda")
load("Cuisines.rda")
```

Do this now, before reading on.  It will take about 2 minutes for the last one. Then, while you're waiting, read the rest of this activity. You'll know it's working if `Restaurants`, `Cuisines`, `ViolationCodes` show up in your account.

## How's the Food?

Government agencies have increasingly been putting data in publicly accessible places.  For example, in India, the <http://attendance.gov.in/> website tracks the attendance at work of government employees.^[See this [New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/world/asia/in-india-government-tracks-its-own.html).]

[New York City publishes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/) many datasets, including health inspections of restaurants.  That's what you're going to work on now.

The data table `Restaurants` contains information about each health violation.  (See the introduction for how to access the data table.)
Note that the `DBA` variable contains the name of the restaurant.^[The data tables are published by the New York City government as a zip file at `https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Restaurant-Inspection-Results/4vkw-7nck?`]


* What is the meaning of a case in this data table?  You can look at the data table with this command: `View( Restaurants )`.
* How many cases are there?

```{r}
Restaurants %>% nrow()
```

* How many distinct restaurant names are there? 

```{r}
Restaurants %>% summarise( nnames=n_distinct( DBA ))
```

* Are there any restaurants with the same name but with multiple branch locations?  Select one or more variables that plausibly identify a unique branch.

```{r}
foo <- 
  Restaurants %>% 
  group_by( DBA ) %>%
  summarise( branches=n_distinct( PHONE ) )
```

```{r}
foo <- 
  Restaurants %>% 
  group_by( DBA ) %>% 
  summarise( count=n(), 
             branches=n_distinct( PHONE), 
             zips=n_distinct(ZIPCODE)) %>%
  arrange( desc( branches ))
```

* Which restaurants (individual branches) have the most violations?

```{r}
foo <-
  Restaurants %>%
  group_by( DBA, PHONE ) %>%
  summarise( count=n() ) %>%
  arrange( desc( count ) )
```


The data table `ViolationCodes` contains a description of the different types of violations and whether they are critical.  `Cuisines` gives the meaning for the `CUISINECODE` variable.  

* How many critical violations were reported?  Non-critical?

* Which restaurants have the greatest number of "critical" violations? Produce a table showing the number of critical and non-critical violations for each restaurant. 

* What's the most common cuisine type in the whole city?  In each borough? In each zip code?

The data table `Cuisines` details the code for each restaurant's cuisine type.

```{r}
load( "Cuisines.rda" )
```

* What kind of cuisine has the most violations per restaurant, on average?


You can create a table where the case is "an individual restaurant branch" with this statement:
```{r echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
RR <- Restaurants %>% 
  group_by( CAMIS, STREET, ZIPCODE ) %>% 
  filter( row_number(ZIPCODE)==1 )
```

Get the latitude and longitude of each zip code from `ZipGeography`.  Plot out the location of each restaurant, using the borough for color. Use the aesthetic 
```
position=position_jitter( width=0.02, height=0.02 )
``` 
to spread out the restaurants a bit. Play with `alpha=` to get a nice graphic.  Which borough corresponds to each borough number?

```{r out.width="4in",out.height="2.5in",dev="png"}
Zips <- ZipGeography %>% select( ZIPCODE=ZIP, Latitude,Longitude)
RR <- Restaurants %>% 
  group_by( PHONE ) %>% 
  filter( row_number(PHONE)==1)
Where <- inner_join( RR, Zips )
p <- 
  ggplot( Where, aes(x=Longitude, y=Latitude, color=BORO)) +
  geom_point(alpha=.1,
             position=position_jitter( width=.02, height=.02),
             show_guide=FALSE) # +
 coord_fixed()
# ggsave(file="NY-Restaurants.png")
```

* Choose 3 or 4 cuisines of interest to you.  Plot out the location of each restaurant of that type as an additional layer on the previous graphic.

* Find the violations that are most likely to be repeated for a given restaurant branch.   (If a violation appears twice or more for a given restaurant branch, the violation extended over more than one inspection period.)



* Make an informative plot of the distribution of `SCORES` for each letter `CURRENTGRADE`.  

* Do the same for the distribution of `SCORES` by `ACTION`.
