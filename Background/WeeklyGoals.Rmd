# COMP 110 - Weekly Goals

&nbsp; <!-- to make room for the title.  Fix this in CSS or with a <div>

&nbsp;

This document is still under construction!!

## Week 1

At the end of this week, you should be able to:

* Log in to the RStudio server (or use a desktop version).
* Create an RMarkdown source file with simple contents.
* Hand in your RMarkdown work.
* Understand what a data table is.
* Be aware of the meaning of the different components of a URL or file name.


## Week 2

Building on the Week 1 goals, at the end of Week 2, you should be able to:

* Be able to relate glyphs and frames to data.  More specifically, seeing a simple scientific graph, be able to sketch in the form of the data table that underlies the graph.
* Use the helper functions `mPlot()`, and `mBar()` to generate graphics interactively by assigning variables to graphicaal attributes.
* Create an Rmd document using the template.
* Add R calculations to an Rmd document using the "chunk" notation.
* Use the `group_by()` and `summarise()` data verbs to calculate all-cases and groupwise summaries of data.
* Be able to chain operations together to produce novel, more complex operations.
* Distinguish between assignment (`<-`) and chaining (`%>%`).
* Use `str()`, `names()`, `nrow()`, and `head()` to get brief displays of data tables, and be able to interpret the output of those functions.
* Be able to use and understand the use of functions such as `mean()`, `sum()`, `n()` as they are involved in `summarise()`.  This includes constructing appropriate variable names in the output of `summarise()` and using the named variable syntax (`=`).
* When getting `NA` as the output of a functions such as `mean()`, using the `na.rm=TRUE` optional argument.^[I hate that you have to use `na.rm=TRUE` so often.  In my view, this is what the default should be.  Unfortunately, it's hard to create a new default value, so we're stuck with specifying `na.rm=TRUE` each time we use the functions.]
* Recognize that `NA`, `NULL`, and `NaN` mean different, albeit related, things.
