# COMP 110 - Installing the DCF Package

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


R provides a standard way to distribute additional data and software: the package.  A package named `DCF` has been created for the Data & Computing Fundamentals course.  You will need to install this package on your R/RStudio system to use its resources.

To install the package, execute these three commands in the console of your RStudio system.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("mosaic")
devtools::install_github("dtkaplan/DCF")
```

You only need to do this once, but if you are using more than one RStudio system (e.g. the cloud server and a desktop version) you'll have to do this on each system.

```{r child="../CSS/DisqusTemplate.Rmd"}
```
